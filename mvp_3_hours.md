we have 3 hours to get this project to mvp (i hope). the frontend and backend are communicating but we need to rework some of the frontend logic to make it as MVP as possible to 0-1

<need_have_features>
- image upload on the frontend
- image parsing and analysis (to come out same output like the summary extractor)
- ability to give name and role on the front end
- last page being able to share the results


<want_have_features>
- rework the logic inside to track people, relationships, and motive and keep a base level of facts
- rework theme into something more sleek like known
- animations given the loading time of the AI questions
