# Drama Detective - Current Functionality

**Last Updated:** October 27, 2025
**Status:** Core functionality implemented and operational

---

## Overview

Drama Detective is an interactive CLI investigation tool that uses a **multi-agent AI system** to analyze interpersonal drama through structured interviews. The system conducts intelligent interviews, extracts facts, tracks investigation goals, and generates comprehensive analysis reports with drama ratings.

---

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Agent Architecture (6 Specialized Agents)

Each agent has a specific role in the investigation pipeline:

- **Goal Generator Agent** (`goal_generator.py`)
  - Creates investigation objectives from initial incident summary
  - Generates structured goals with status tracking
  - Sets initial confidence scores

- **Question Generator Agent** (`question_generator.py`)
  - Generates contextual interview questions based on current state
  - Creates 4 multiple-choice answers with reasoning for each option
  - Adapts questions based on goals, facts, and conversation history
  - Handles drift redirect suggestions
  - Determines when investigation is complete (wrap_up signal)

- **Fact Extractor Agent** (`fact_extractor.py`)
  - Extracts concrete, verifiable claims from user responses
  - Categorizes facts by topic
  - Assigns timestamps and confidence levels ("certain" or "uncertain")
  - Tracks source attribution

- **Drift Detector Agent** (`drift_detector.py`)
  - Monitors if user answers stay on-topic
  - Runs every 3 turns to check for conversational drift
  - Provides redirect suggestions when answers go off-topic
  - Returns addressed_question boolean and redirect_suggestion text

- **Goal Tracker Agent** (`goal_tracker.py`)
  - Updates goal confidence scores (0-100) based on newly extracted facts
  - Marks goals as complete when sufficient information gathered
  - Tracks investigation progress dynamically

- **Analysis Agent** (`agent_analysis.py`)
  - Synthesizes all gathered data into final verdict
  - Generates timeline of events
  - Identifies key facts and unanswered questions
  - Assigns primary responsibility with percentage
  - Rates drama on 1-10 scale with explanation

## Data Models (Pydantic)

### Session
- `session_id`: UUID string
- `incident_name`: User-provided name
- `created_at`: ISO timestamp
- `status`: ACTIVE | PAUSED | COMPLETE
- `summary`: Initial incident description
- `goals`: List of Goal objects
- `messages`: Conversation history (Message objects)
- `facts`: Extracted facts (Fact objects)
- `answers`: Current multiple-choice options (Answer objects)
- `current_question`: Currently displayed question
- `turn_count`: Number of Q&A exchanges

### Goal
- `description`: Goal text
- `status`: NOT_STARTED | IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETE
- `confidence`: Integer 0-100 (auto-clamped)

- `topic`: Category/subject
- `claim`: The actual fact statement
- `source`: Attribution (default: "user")
- `timestamp`: Optional time reference
- `confidence`: "certain" or "uncertain"

### Message

---

## Session Management

### SessionManager Class (`session.py`)

**Functionality:**
- Creates unique session IDs (UUID4)
- Saves sessions as JSON files
- Loads sessions from disk
- Lists all sessions sorted by creation date
- Handles corrupted file gracefully (skips them)

**Storage Location:**
- Default: `.drama/.sessions/` in project root
- Customizable via `data_dir` parameter
- Auto-creates directories if missing

**File Format:**
- JSON serialization via Pydantic `model_dump()`
- Filename: `{session_id}.json`
- Human-readable with 2-space indentation

---

## Interview Orchestration

### InterviewOrchestrator Class (`interview.py`)

**Responsibilities:**
- Coordinates all 6 agents in sequence
- Manages interview state and flow
- Tracks turn count
- Determines completion status

**Agent Pipeline per Turn:**
1. Add user message to history
2. Extract facts from answer
3. Check for drift (every 3rd turn)
4. Update goal confidence scores
5. Generate next question with answers
6. Check if investigation complete
7. Add assistant message to history

**Session Isolation:**
- Each orchestrator stores `session_id`
- Passes session_id to all agent calls for context isolation

---

## API Integration

### ClaudeClient (`api_client.py`)

- Wraps Anthropic Claude API
- Provides unified interface for all agents
- Handles API key management
- Supports system prompts and message history
- Returns parsed JSON responses from agents
